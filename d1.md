# Lesson Plan

## Intro to programming

#### Zen and the art of programming

* A computer will always do exactly what you tell it to, no more and no less.
* There's no bullshitting in programming. Your program either works or it doesn't, and no amount of cleverness or importance will change that.

In order to be a great software engineer, there are certain tangental skills that must be cultivated:

* Logical Reasoning
* Numerical Reasoning
* Procedural Reasoning
* Curiosity
* Debugging
* **Patience**

One of the primary goals of the course is to provide you with the a foundation and resources to develop these skills.

#### The Complexity of Programming

*The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.*

-Edsger Dijkstra

Once you start implementing programs of a sufficient complexity, you will find that it is very easy to make mistakes. Unlike computers, the human brain does not always think in perfect logic or arithmetic. The software engineers of the past quickly realized this and started developing techniques and structures to manage the complexity of their programs: variables, good style, abstraction and decomposition, objects and classes. Don't worry if some of those words seem unfamiliar. We will explore them all and more in the course.

* The terminal
* IRB

## Functions
* The building blocks of all programs
* `def` and `end`
* Function arguments
* Watch your indentation!
* Functions can call other functions

Exercises:
  * Write a function called `hello_world` will `puts` the string `"Hello world!"` to the screen.
  * Write a function called `print_thrice(num)` that, given a number, will print out the number three times.
  * Write a function called `print_thrice_thrice(num)` that, given a number, will call `print_thrice` with that number three times (for 9 total prints).

## Numbers
* Mathematical operators
* Integer division (`/`)
* Modulo (`%`)
* `+=`, `-=`, `/=` etc.

Exercises:
  * Write a function called `times_three_and_plus_five(num)` that takes a number, multiplies it by 3, and then adds 5. For example, `times_three_and_plus_five(4)` should output 17.
  * Write a function called `even_or_odd(num)` that prints `"even"` if the number is even, and prints `"odd"` if the number is odd.
  * Write a function called `division_plus_remainder(big_num, small_num)` that finds the number of times `small_num` completely divides into `big_num`, and then adds the remainder that's left over. For example, `divisor_plus_remainder(7, 2)` should equal `4`.
  * Write a function called `is_factor_of(big_num, small_num)` that returns `true` if `small_num` is a factor of `big_num`, and `false` if it is not.

## Booleans and loops
* Booleans
* `while` loops — `while(condition)`, do stuff, `end`
* Conditionals and control flow
  * `elsif` and `else`
* Comparators that produce booleans: `==`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`

Exercises:
  * Write a `while` loop that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 25 inclusive.
  * Write a function called `print_up_to(num)` that given a number, prints out all the numbers from 1 to that number, inclusive. It should use a `while` loop internally.
  * Write a function called `print_factors(num)` that prints all of the factors of a number, including 1 and the number itself.
    * Hint: use your `is_factor_of(big_num, small_num)` function.

## Implicit and explicit returns
* `return` jumps all the way out of the function

Exercise:
  * Write a function `largest_factor(num)` that returns the largest factor of a number. Adapt your `print_factors` method to use a `while` loop starting at `num - 1`, and return immediately once you find a number that's a factor.
  * Write a function `is_prime?(num)` that returns a boolean depending on whether the number is prime. A reminder: a prime number only has two factors: 1 and itself.
    * Once you've written it, see if you can use an early `return` on numbers that you know for sure aren't prime, without having to check every possible factor.


## Advanced Conditionals
* `if` vs. `unless`
* `while` vs. `until`
* Logical operators (`&&` = and, `||` = or, `!` = not)
* Parenthesization
* Truth tables

Exercise:
  * Complete these truth tables. Write it out on pencil and paper in your notebook.

x  | y   | z   | x && y &#124;&#124; z |  x && (y &#124;&#124; z)
-----|-----|-----|-----------------------|--------------------------
true |true |false|                       |
true |false|false|                       |
false|true |false|                       |
false|false|false|                       |


  x  | y   | z   | x &#124;&#124; y && z |  x &#124;&#124; (y && z)
-----|-----|-----|-----------------------|-------------------------
true |true |false|                       |
true |false|false|                       |
false|true |false|                       |
false|false|false|                       |
  * Using pen and paper, see if you can figure out the value of these conditionals:
    1. `F || (T || F)`
    2. `(T && F) || F`
    3. `(T || F) && (F && T)`
    4. `3 == 5 || 4 % 2 > 2`
    5. `6 + 4 <= 10 && 5 != 6`
    6. `(6 != 6 || (1 == 10 % 3)) && (3 + 5 < 6)`
  * Write an `until` loop that prints out all of the numbers that are less than 20 and are not divisible by 6.

## Strings
* String methods
  * `#upcase`
  * `#downcase`
  * `+`
  * `string[idx]` to look up the character at an index
  * `string[idx] = letter` to assign a character at an index
  * `#split(char_to_split_on)` to split a string into an array of parts

* Exercises:
  * Write a function `capitalize(str)` that takes in a string, capitalizes the first letter of the string, and returns the string.
  * Write a function `shout_then_whisper(str1, str2)` that takes in two strings, and shouts the first part, then whispers the second part. The output should look like this:
    * `shout_then_whisper("Hello", "McDouglas") == "HELLO!! ... mcdouglas"`

## Arrays
* Array methods
  * `#length` or `#size` or `#count`
  * `arr[idx]`
  * `arr[idx] = val`
  * `#first`
  * `#last`
  * `#include?(val)`
  * `#push(val)` to add a value onto the end (also `<<`)
  * `#pop` to pop off a value from the end
  * `#unshift(val)` to stick a value onto the beginning
  * `#shift` to shift off a value from the beginning
  * `#join(separator)` to join an array of strings, separated by a delimiter

* Exercises:
  * Write a function `first_n_evens(n)` that returns an array of the first N many even numbers, starting from 0.
  * Write a function `reverse(arr)` that reverses an array in-place.
  * Write a function `rotate(arr, shift)` that given an array, rotates it in-place by the shift amount. E.g., `rotate([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)` should produce `[3, 4, 1, 2]`. `rotate([5, 6, 7], -1)` should produce `[7, 5, 6]`.
    * Hint: a combination of `#shift`, `#unshift`, `#pop` and `#push` should come in handy here.
  * Write a function `all_uniqs(arr1, arr2)` that given two arrays, produces a new array of only elements unique to `arr1` and elements unique to `arr2`. E.g., `combine_uniques([2, 5, 7], [1, 2, 7])` should return `[1, 5]`

## Iteration
* Iteration and blocks (`each`)
* Blocks — `do` `|arg1, arg2|`, then code stuff, then `end`
* `array.each_with_index` yields `|el, i|`
* `string.chars.each_with_index` gives you the same

Exercises:
  * Write a function called `vowels(str)` that returns an array of every vowel in the string.
    * Use the `String#chars` method, which returns an array of characters. Then use an `each` over the chars.
  * Write a function called `odd_elems(arr)` that prints out every other element (those with odd indices). Use `each_with_index`.
  * Write a function called `zip_with_indices(arr)` that given an array, converts each element into a tuple with its index.
    * E.g., `zip_with_indices([3, 20, 8]) == [[3, 0], [20, 1], [8, 2]]`

## `nil`
* Everything returns something in Ruby
* Specifically, it often returns `nil`
* Chances are, if you're getting a `nil`, you're doing something wrong

## Output
* `p` and `puts`
  * `p` returns the thing you're printing, `puts` returns `nil`

## Advanced iteration
* `break`
* `next`

* Exercises:
  * Adapt your `odd_elems(arr)` function to use `next` to skip over every even-indexed element.
  * Write a function `first_n_primes(n)` that returns the first N many prime numbers. You'll want to use your `is_prime?` function that you wrote earlier. Use `break` in your function.

## Naming your variables and refactoring
* Be as expressive and specific as possible
* Break down operations into multiple named steps
* Make your code read like English!

* Exercise:
  * Refactor this tip-calculating function. Try to rename the variables and to make it more expressive, and take advantage of early returns.

```ruby
def ct(x)
  r = 0
  if x < 5
    r = 1
  elsif x < 10
    r = x * .18
  else
    r = x * .13
  end
  r
end
```

  * Refactor this function that returns the Nth biggest prime number. Don't start by trying to undrstand what it's doing—first just start renaming the variables. Then, once you see what it's doing, make it use your own `is_prime?` function to pull out some of the complexity and make it more readable!
```ruby
def pr(x)
  c = 0
  n = 2
  while true
    i = 2
    f = true
    while i < n
      if n % i == 0
        f = false
        break
      end
      i += 1
    end
    if f
      c += 1
      if c == x
        return n
      end
    end
    n += 1
  end
end
```
* Exercise:
  * CATS IN HATS
