# Curriculum
Get started by going to your day's work:
##### [Day 1](./d1.md)

#### Problem Sets

If you're done with the main curriculum, you can start working through the problem sets:
##### [Problem set 1](./problem-sets/problem-set-1.md)

#### CodeEval
Once you're finished, jump onto [CodeEval](http://codeeval.com) and work through some problems in Ruby. Don't worry if you don't get here, we'll all jump on CodeEval together as the course progresses.

# Final Assessment

On the final day of the Jump Start course (Friday), we will give you a final assessment. The assessment will begin place 2 hours before the end of the day, and will last for one hour. The assessment will be a power-test—that is, we're going to give you more problems than you can probably solve in an hour, and it's up to you which ones you work on and how many you solve.

We'll give you more information about it going forward, but rest assured that we know what's on the assessment, and will be tailoring the curriculum to give you everything you need to do well.

Just keep coming in, make sure you get plenty of sleep, and you should be fully prepared by Friday.
