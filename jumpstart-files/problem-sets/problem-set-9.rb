# This file is in the same format as your assessments.
#
# Make sure everything puts out as 'true' when you run the file.
#
# Give yourself an hour to complete this assessment.
# When time is up, make sure you don't have any unexpected `end`s or infinite loops
# that would keep your code from running.
#
# Rename the file to be your firstname and lastname.
#
# Do not use the internet.  If you forget a particular ruby method, write it yourself.
#
# Test your code with a few cases in addition to the ones we give
# you.  When we grade you, we use different test cases to make sure your logic
# is sound.
#
# Look at the test cases below the problem before you approach it.
# Use the debugger when code doesn't run how you expect.

# Price is Right
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Given a list of bids and an actual retail price, return the bid that is closest
# to the actual retail price without going over that price.

# Assume there is always at least one bid below the retail price.

# Total Product Sequence
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# start with).  The next number in the sequence is the product of all the numbers
# before it.  Given a number n, find the nth number of the total product sequence.

# Products Except Me
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Given an array of numbers, calculate all the different products that remain when
# you take each element out of the array.

#   12 because you take out 2, leaving 3 * 4
#   8, because you take out 3, leaving 2 * 4
#   6, because you take out 4, leaving 2 * 3
# ]
#
# [1, 2, 3, 5] => [30, 15, 10, 6], where:
#   30 because you take out 1, leaving 2 * 3 * 5
#   15, because you take out 2, leaving 1 * 3 * 5
