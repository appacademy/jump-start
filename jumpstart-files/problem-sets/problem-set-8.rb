# This file is in the same format as your assessments.
#
# Make sure everything puts out as 'true' when you run the file.
#
# Give yourself an hour to complete this assessment.
# When time is up, make sure you don't have any unexpected `end`s or infinite loops
# that would keep your code from running.
#
# Rename the file to be your firstname and lastname.
#
# Do not use the internet.  If you forget a particular ruby method, write it yourself.
#
# Test your code with a few cases in addition to the ones we give
# you.  When we grade you, we use different test cases to make sure your logic
# is sound.
#
# Look at the test cases below the problem before you approach it.
# Use the debugger when code doesn't run how you expect.
