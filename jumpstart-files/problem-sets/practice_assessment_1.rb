# This file is in the same format as your assessments.
#
# Make sure everything puts out as 'true' when you run the file.
#
# Give yourself 15 minutes per problem.  When time is up, make sure you don't
# have any unexpected `end`s or infinite loops that would keep your code from
# running.
#
# Rename the file to be your firstname and lastname.
#
# Do not use the internet.  If you forget a particular ruby method, write it yourself.
#
# Look at the test cases below the problem before you approach it.
# Use the debugger when code doesn't run how you expect.

# Word With Most Repeats
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Given a sentence, find which word has the greatest amount of repeated letters.
#
# For example, "I took the road less traveled and that has made all the difference"
# should return "difference" because it has two repeated letters (f and e).
#
# All words will be separated by spaces and there will be no punctuation or
# capitalization.  If there is a tie return the first word.  It doesn't matter
# how many times individual letters repeat, just that they repeat (see the third test
# case).

def word_with_most_repeats(sentence)
end

# Isogram Matcher
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An isogram is a word with only unique, non-repeating letters. Given two isograms
# of the same length, return an array with two numbers indicating matches:
# the first number is the number of letters matched in both words at the same position,
# and the second is the number of letters matched in both words but not in the
# same position.

  #
  # your code goes here

# Xbonacci
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Write a Xbonacci function that works similarly to the fibonacci sequence.
# The fibonacci sequence takes the last two numbers in the sequence and adds
# them together to create the next number.
#
# First five fibonacci numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
# The fourth fibonacci number (3) is the sum of the two numbers before it
# (1 and 2).
#
# In Xbonacci, the sum of the last X numbers (instead of the last 2 numbers)
# of the sequence becomes the next number in the sequence.
#
# The method will take two inputs: the starting sequence with X number of
# elements and an integer N, and return the first N elements in the given
# sequence.  Take a look at the test cases for examples.
#
# In the code, how_many_numbers_to_sum is the same as X (name your variables
# descriptively!).
#
# In the code, number_of_fibonacci_numbers_to_return is the same as N.

def xbonacci(starting_sequence, number_of_xbonacci_numbers_to_return)
  # how_many_numbers_to_sum = starting_sequence.length

  #
  # your code goes here

#  Cupcake Solver
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It's Jennifer's birthday today. Jennifer's mom decided to bake different kinds
# of cupcakes for Jennifer's first grade class.  Everybody needs to have an equal
# amount of the different kinds of cupcakes.

# Write a method that takes an array of the counts of the different kinds of
# cupcakes and the number of students in the class, and returns
# the total number of cupcakes that each student in the class
# should get.

# Every student should have equal amounts of the same kind of cupcake.
# No student gets to have more cupcakes than the others.  There can be leftover
# cupcakes.

# An array of [1, 2, 3] means that there's one red velvet cupcake,
# two vanilla cupcakes, and three chocolate cupcakes.

# Example: cupcake_solver([10, 10, 10], 5) == 6  means that there are five
# students in the class, and each student gets to eat six cupcakes, total.


def cupcake_solver(cupcake_counts, number_of_students_in_class)

  # your code goes here
