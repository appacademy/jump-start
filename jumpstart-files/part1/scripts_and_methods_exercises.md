# Scripts and Methods Exercises

0. Create a new file, `methods_exercises.rb`. Define the following methods in this script:

0. Write a method `#print_thrice`, that accepts a string as an argument. It should `puts` that string 3 times.

  ```ruby
    def print_thrice(string)
      # Your code here
    end
  ```

0. Write a method, `#print_thrice_thrice`, that also accepts a string as an argument. It should call `print_thrice` with that string three times (for 9 total prints).

0. Write a method, `#add_multiply_subtract`, that accepts two integers as arguments. Your method should do the following:
  * add the to numbers
  * multiply the two numbers
  * subtract the sum from the product
  * puts the result

You should create 3 variables (sum, product, difference) to help keep your code neat and clean!


0. Test your methods by invoking them in your script and running your script from the terminal.
