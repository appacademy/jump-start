# Code Style Exercises

0. The methods below contain valid Ruby code. However, the styling could use some work. See how many style problems you can fix (including variable/method naming).

  ```ruby
  def  hello_world
  puts "Hello, world!" end
  ```

  ```ruby
    def is_prime num
    n = 2
    while n < num
        if (num%n==0)
          return (false)
        end
        n = n + 1
      end
      return true
    end
  ```

**Mandatory TA Checkpoint!** Call over a TA and ask them to review your code for style.
