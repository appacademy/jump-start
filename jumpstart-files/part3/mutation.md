* Safe vs. unsafe methods. The bang, `!`, at the end of the method name denotes an unsafe method.
* The bang generally means the method mutates the input.
* Pay attention to whether you need to re-assign your variable, or mutate it in your function.
* Some Ruby objects are **immutable**, which means they cannot mutate. You must create a new and different object and re-assign your variable if you want to change an immutable object.
* Things that are immutable:
  * Booleans (`true`/`false`)
  * `nil`
  * Numbers
* Arrays and hashes are **mutable**. `[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7]` is an array with some immutable elements, and one mutable element. This could make a difference if you are iterating over elements of an array and changing them as you go.
* Here's a rule of thumb for mutability—if you can pass it into a function and change the object, then it's mutable. Otherwise it's not.
* Think about it: can you imagine something immutable, like `true` or `0` changing because you called some function?

    ```ruby
  variable = false
  crazy_function_that_does_crazy_things!(variable)
  puts variable == false # no function can change its value!
    ```
